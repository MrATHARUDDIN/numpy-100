#### 4. How to find the memory size of any array (★☆☆)

N = np.zeros((10,10)) # This makes a array of 10*10 with zeros
print("%d bytes" % (N.size * N.itemsize)) 

# %d for integer 
# N.size return total number in the array (since it's 10 row * 10 columns = 100 elements)
# N.itemsize return bytes of each element 
# For float64(default) = 8 bytes

#### 8. Reverse a vector (first element becomes last) (★☆☆)
